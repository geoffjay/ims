# Image Manipulation Service

_Doesn't work, go away if you like things that work._

Humble beginnings of a thing that is intended to provide an image analysis/manipulation pipeline in the form of an
extensible service. The image pipeline and the REST route provider are available to addins using `libpeas`.
